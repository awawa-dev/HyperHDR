## About 

This fork is based on [Hyperion](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng) that is an opensource [Bias or Ambient Lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_lighting) implementation which you might know from TV manufacturers. It supports many LED devices and video grabbers. The project is still in a alpha development stage (no stable release available).

### New features of this fork:

* <b>Really low CPU</b> usage on SoCs like Raspberry Pi
* HDR color correction
* support for multitreading for USB grabbers
